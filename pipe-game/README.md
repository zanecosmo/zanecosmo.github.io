# Pipe-Game
A puzzle game that revolves around putting pieces of pipes together. Fluid will run through the pipes nd must make it from the start to the finish in order to complete the level. Each level will only provide the player with a certain number and certain types of peices with whcich to build their system.

My purpose for this project was the following:
* improve my ability to use the basic tools of Javascript in more interesting and advanced ways
* employ knowledge I've gained about data structures
* build a project using a rendering technology (HTML5 Canvas) besides CSS and HTML elements

## Status
In development.

#### Possible Features:
* ability to save level states and progress with password (this would entail creating a DB and wiring up some async HTTP-request functionality)

## About
I will use [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/about) to host this game on an Express/Node.js back-end. It uses almost entirely Javascript and utilizes HTML5's Canvas element for rendering.
