# Website / Portfolio
This is the first version of my portfolio website, which currently displays three of my many personal projects. I am working on a slighty more involved React project which will soon be added, and I also have plans for website overhaul. I'd like the site to be more visually interesting and to reflect my current skills.

My purposes for this site are fairly straightforward:
- Show interested parties projects that I have completed.
- Demonstrate some level of comepetence with web design, developement, programming, hosting, and other software-related skills for potential employers, clients, and/or business partners.
- Have fun making my own website!

#### Possible Features:
- Rework the color palette and site-layout to something more modern and pleasing to the eye.
- Improve UI components and layout associated with the list of portfolio projects.
- Make the site more visually interesting by adding tasteful amounts of animation and relevent media.

## About
Currently the site is hosted from an AWS S3 bucket, with the interactive demos being hosted on various other platforms. The site was created using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
